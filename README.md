# prnmacro
A Microsoft Word macro to format .prn files from E-reports for sane viewing.

.prn files from E-reports do not format properly by default in Microsoft Word.  This macro will adjust the orientation, change font, and remove the leading blank page from most E-reports files.

To install it, navigate to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates

First, make a backup of the existing Normal.dotm.  Then replace it with this one.  

Once the new template is copied, you can open Word and go to File, Options, Quick Access Toolbar and set it to "choose from Macros." This will add a button at the top-left of the Word window to quickly run the macro.

code.txt has the macro code written out for analysis or for copying manually (if you need to integrate it with existing macros).
